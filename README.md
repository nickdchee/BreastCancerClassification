# Breast Cancer Classification

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset consists of 699 samples with 30 features collected from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) in order to diagnose whether or not a patient has breast cancer.  In particular, a tumor may be classified as malignant (and therefore the cells inside the tumor are cancerous),  or benign (in which,  the tumor is normal.)  An early diagnosis of such tumors is greatly important; when detected early, there is a 30% chance of effective treatment, compared to late stage treatment.

In this analysis, we will examine a few classification techniques to diagnostically predict whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign. We chose the following methods to conduct our analysis:

- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
